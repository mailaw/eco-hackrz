# eco-hackrz

The EcoTrackrz full-stack web application is inspired by "citizen science." Users input information about their daily actions that are related to impact on the environment. These individual-level logs culminate into a larger database, which provides insights about different ecological impacts people are making on regional and national levels. The user inputted data is also visually represented through js plugins that process the data onto maps and other status bar-like visualizations.

"I'm just one person and my one action does not matter."
By providing visualizations of their individual impact along with their communities', we hope to diminish this attitude.
